# Android JNI Examples

This project demonstrates example interactions between C and Java using JNI on the Android platform.

Example includes concepts such as:
 - Calling C functions from Java
 - Calling Java functions from C
 - Passing/handling different Java primitives in C
 - Handling different C primitives passed to Java

**Note: This does not use cmake. Please see my other project https://github.com/MarkMurillo/android_jni_swig_example for a more modern build process.**
